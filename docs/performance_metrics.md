## 📊 Metrics Summary

| Metric                     | Value                    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Batch Interval**        | 5 seconds                |
| **Events per Batch**      | 50                       |
| **Average Ingestion Rate**| ~10 events/second        |
| **Processing Latency**    | 1.2 - 2.5 seconds/batch   |
| **Spark Throughput**      | ~20–40 records/sec       |
| **PostgreSQL Write Time** | < 0.5 seconds per batch  |
| **Checkpoint Delay**      | Negligible               |
| **Failed Batches**        | 0                        |

## 📉 Observations

- Spark successfully ingested and processed data files with low latency.
- PostgreSQL consistently handled inserts with no noticeable delay or locking issues.
- System remained stable under continuous data generation.
- Scaling up the event generation rate (e.g., 200 events/file) led to a minor increase in Spark processing time (~3.5 seconds).
- Checkpointing ensured resilience without duplicate data when tested with Spark restart.

## ✅ Recommendations

- For larger scale deployments, consider distributed Spark clusters and optimized batch sizes.
- PostgreSQL performance can be improved with batch inserts and indexing on event_time/user_id.
- Monitor system memory usage for long-running jobs to prevent memory bloat.
